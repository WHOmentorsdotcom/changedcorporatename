    <br>BLACK GIRLS CODE INC., California Foreign Nonprofit Entity Number: 4834848, lawfully registered the corporate name while BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3458407, incorporated on March 2, 2012, and BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990, incorporated on March 23, 2012, renamed BGC, NC. on February 22, 2022, were both suspended by the California Secretary of State and lost the rights to the corporate name.
    <br>
    <br>Moreover, sections 14415 and 14417 of the California Business and Profession Code (BPC), DO NOT APPLY to BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990, that filed articles of incorporation pursuant to section 5120 and 5122(b), in effect in 2012, as a CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION, not section 200 as alleged, and relied upon, by DLA PIPER attorneys for BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990.
    <br>
    <br>BLACK GIRLS CODE INC., California Foreign Nonprofit Entity Number: 4834848, contends Service Mark Registration Number 6145379 was obtained fraudulently and BGC, INC. unlawfully used the name, BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC. from March 23, 2012 to February 21, 2022, as defined by
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=14495.">ยง 14495 of CA BPC</a>. Sofia Mohammed submitted a Fictitious Business Name (FBN) Statement in the County of Alameda, California only, File Number: 588878, stating BGC, INC. commenced using the name BLACK GIRLS CODE on March 23, 2012, and not earlier in 2011.
    <br>
    <br>An attorney <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88603169&docId=ROA20200515192058#docIndex=12&page=1">for BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3453990, renamed BGC, INC., claimed</a>, "The mark has become distinctive of the goods/services through the applicant's substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. Congress may lawfully regulate for at least the five years immediately before the date of this statement." However, Kimberly Bryant filed a <a href="https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/api/report/GetImageByNum/242150040250039123157023238153178058044065121077">Statement of Information for BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC. (3458407) on Octiber 24, 2015.</a>
    <br>
    <br>Kimberly Bryant filed a federal lawsuit, 4:22-cv-04643, Bryant v. Hiles et al, on August 11, 2022, before she was removed as a director and dismissed as the CEO on August 12, 2022. The complaint alleges Sofia Mohammed and Heather Hiles, Stacy Brown-Philpot, and Sherman Whites, transferred the entire balance of the sole proprietorship business banking account, on or about February 5, 2022 while BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3453990, renamed BGC, INC., was suspended. 
    <br>
    <br>Suspension means the corporation loses its rights to its name. In California it's also a crime (a misdemeanor) for someone to transact, or try to transact, business through a suspended corporation.
    <br>
    <br>The allegation is that the Ficitious Business Name FBN or Doing Business As (DBA) Statement, filed on January 24, 2012, was used to open a bank account at Wells Fargo. An employee generated an employer identification number (EIN) for BLACK GIRLS CODE as a sole proprietorship, not one of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporations. The EIN does not match the EIN used for annual filinigs submitted to the IRS, California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and California Attorney General's Office Registry of Charitable Trusts.
    <br>
    <br>If true, the way to solve thiis is for Kimberly Bryant to claim that the two (2) applications for service mark registrations, 4264205 and 6145379, contained the wrong ENTITY TYPE and should be updated to BLACK GIRLS CODE (SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP).
    <br>
    <br>BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC. (Califorina Entity Number: 3453990), renamed BGC, INC., filed a federal lawsuit 4:22-cv-04801 against Kimberly Bryant claiming, "At all times relevant herein, BGC owned and had a right to possess the BGC Website [since 2011 and including a sole proprietorship which is for profit."
    <br>
    <br>A motion hearing on Tuesday, August 30, 2022, wiil shed light on whether Kimberly Bryant owns the domains she purchased on March 25, 2011.
