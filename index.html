    <br>
    <br>Moreover, sections 14415 and 14417 of the California Business and Profession Code (BPC), DO NOT APPLY to BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990, formerly known as BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., that filed articles of incorporation pursuant to section 5120 and 5122(b), in effect in 2012, as a CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION, not section 200 as alleged, and relied upon, by DLA PIPER attorneys for BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990.

    <br>On April 27,2022, Sofia Mohammed appoined <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88603169&docId=CAR20220428095851#docIndex=1&page=1">DLA PIPER as the Attorney of Record with the USPTO</a>. In-turn, DLA PIPER filed a Section 7 Request Form claiming, "The original applicant name was inadvertently entered without the INC. In other words, the name of the applicant in the original application was entered as Black Girls Code, a California corporation. The applicant name should have read as BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., a California corporation. Since otherwise, the original information for the applicant was correctly entered, identifying it as a California corporation, it is believed this request is acceptable. Further, The entity initially identified as Black Girls Code, a California corporation, did not exist as a legal entity on the application filing date. TMEP Section 803.02; TMEP Section 1201.02(c) The undersigned now respectfully requests that this change be accepted and entered into the record." 
    <br>
    <br>NOTE: The Business Programs Division, California Secretary of State's office, experienced substantial delays, in 2011-2012, with filings of articles of incorpration and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120509091903/http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/processing-times.htm">had not processed the "eligible document" on, or before, May 8, 2012</a>, the day the first servide mark application was filed.
    <br>
    <br>On May 5, 2022, Sofia Mohammed also submitted a Fictitious Business Name (FBN) Statement in the County of Alameda, California only, File Number: 588878, stating BGC, INC. commenced using the name BLACK GIRLS CODE on March 23, 2012, and not earlier such as March 2, 2012, or earlier in 2011.
    <br>
    <br>An attorney <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88603169&docId=ROA20200515192058#docIndex=12&page=1">for BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3453990, renamed BGC, INC., claimed</a>, "The mark has become distinctive of the goods/services through the applicant's substantially exclusive and continuous use of the mark in commerce that the U.S. Congress may lawfully regulate for at least the five years immediately before the date of this statement." However, Kimberly Bryant filed a <a href="https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/api/report/GetImageByNum/242150040250039123157023238153178058044065121077">Statement of Information for BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC. (3458407) on Octiber 24, 2015.</a>
    <br>
    <br>Kimberly Bryant filed a federal lawsuit, 4:22-cv-04643, Bryant v. Hiles et al, on August 11, 2022, before she was removed as a director and dismissed as the CEO on August 12, 2022. The complaint alleges Sofia Mohammed and Heather Hiles, Stacy Brown-Philpot, and Sherman Whites, transferred the entire balance of the sole proprietorship business banking account, on or about February 5, 2022 while BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3453990, renamed BGC, INC., was suspended. 
    <br>
    <br>Suspension of the rights, privileges, and powers means the corporation is "unconsious" or "incapacitated." In California it's also <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=RTC&sectionNum=19719.">a crime (a misdemeanor) for someone to transact, or try to transact, business through a suspended corporation</a>.
    <br>
    <br>The allegation is that the Ficitious Business Name (FBN) or Doing Business As (DBA) Statement, filed on January 24, 2012, was used to open a bank account at Wells Fargo. An employee generated an employer identification number (EIN) for BLACK GIRLS CODE as a sole proprietorship, not one of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporations. The EIN does not match the EIN used for annual filinigs submitted to the IRS, California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and California Attorney General's Office Registry of Charitable Trusts.
    <br>
    <br>If true, the way to solve this is for Kimberly Bryant to claim that the two (2) applications for service mark registrations, 4264205 and 6145379, contained the wrong ENTITY TYPE and should be updated to BLACK GIRLS CODE (SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP).
    <br>
    <br>BGC, INC. (Califorina Entity Number: 3453990), formerly known as BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., filed a federal lawsuit <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/45694826/BGC,_Inc,_a_California_nonprofit_organization_v_Bryant">3:22-cv-04801</a> against Kimberly Bryant claiming, "At all times relevant herein, BGC owned and had a right to possess the BGC Website [since 2011 and including a sole proprietorship which is for profit]."
    <br>
    <br>On August 27, 2022, Heather Hiles, claimed, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/25/black-girls-code-board-member-heather-hiles-breaks-silence-after-allegations/">"I have never tried to manage or access any of the BGC assets,"<a/> and she also also claimed, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/the-chair-of-black-girls-code-denies-false-and-outrageous-claims-of-a-power-grab-by-the-nonprofits-ousted-ceo-kimberly-bryant/articleshow/93787073.cms">"I am not trying to take over BGC."</a>
    <br>
    <br>On August 30, 2022, Jacqueline Scott Corley, United States District Judge, DENIED the request filed by DLA PIPER LLP for a temporary restraining order for Kimberly Bryant to reinstate blackgirlscode.com and other domains to point to the BGC website.
    <br>
    <br>Yet on September 14, 2022, Tamany Vinson Bentz, attorney from DLA PIPER, filed a renewed motion for a TRO with a declaration that the domain name <a href="http://www.blackgirlscode.com">blackgirlscode.com</a> is valued at $3 million dollars.
    <br>
    <br>On Friday, September 23, 2022, the judge stayed the order for Kimberly Bryant to yield all administrative rights to the register.com account but all domains are required to point to <a href=https://www.wearebgc.org">wearbgc.org</a>.
    <br>
    <br>Kimberly Bryant was the first to register the name in the County of San Francisco, California. Her exclusive right extends over BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., 3458407, and BGC, INC., 3453990, formerly known as BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., that both registered in the County of San Francisco, California. By legal definition, BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., 3458407, is the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=14492.">original owner</a> of the name, not BGC, INC.
    <br>
    <br>On Wednesday, September 28, 2022, "[t]he parties confirmed that the domain names <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.com">blackgirlscode.com</a>, <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.org">blackgirlscode.org, <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.site">blackgirlscode.site</a>, and <a href="https://www.blackgirlscode.net">blackgirlscode.net</a>, have all been redirected to [BGC, INC.'s] new website: <a href="https://www.wearbgc.com">wearebgc.com</a>. In light of this, the Court modifie[d] its order granting [BGC, INC.'s] renewed motion for a temporary restraining order as follows: Mr. Bryant is not required to provide [BGC, INC. or it's counsel Tamany Vinson Bentz, DLA PIPER LLP] with her administrative credentials for Register.com;" that contains the domain <a href="https://www.saveblackgirlscode.com">saveblackgirlscode.com</a>.
