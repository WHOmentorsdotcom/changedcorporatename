    <br>In compliance with the Preliminary Injuction Order issued on 7/25/2022, the use and operation of this domain has been paused.
    <br>
    <br>The Court/Judge stated, <b>"At this juncture, however, [the preliminary injunction order] will neither require [BLACK GIRLS CODE INC.] to change [its] corporate name nor give up ownership of [its] URLs or Twitter handles." "However, as this litigation proceeds, nothing in this Order shall preclude [BLACK GIRLS CODE INC.] from seeking to dissolve the injunction based on discovery."</b>
    <br>
    <br>BLACK GIRLS CODE INC., California Foreign Nonprofit Entity Number: 4834848, lawfully registered the corporate name while BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3458407 and BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990, were both suspended by the California Secretary of State and lost the rights to the corporate name.
    <br>
    <br>Moreover, sections 14415 and 14417 of the CA Business and Profession Code, DO NOT APPLY to BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990, that filed articles of incorporation pursuant to section 5120 and 5122(b), in effect in 2012, as a CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION, not section 200 as alleged, and relied upon, by DLA PIPER attorneys for BGC, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3453990.

    <br>BLACK GIRLS CODE INC., California Foreign Nonprofit Entity Number: 4834848, contends Service Mark Registration Number 6145379 was obtained fraudulently and intends to prove <a href="https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/api/report/GetImageByNum/171199240122020026232051136230133068247183242191">BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., Califorina Entity Number: 3458407</a> incorporated on March 2, 2012, is the original owner as defined by <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=14492.">ยง 14492 of CA BPC</a>,
and BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC., California Entity Number: 3453990, incorporated on March 23, 2012, renamed BGC, INC. on February 22, 2022, led by a Special Committee of Three Directors: Heather Hiles, Stacy Brown-Philpot, and Sherman Whites, who "sent a note to [Kimberly Bryant's] personal email notifying her that she had been 'suspended indefinitely.'"<a/>, unlawfully used the name, BLACK GIRLS CODE, INC. from March 23, 2012 to February 21, 2022, as defined by
<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=BPC&sectionNum=14495.">ยง 14495 of CA BPC</a>.
    <br>
    <br>We are aware Kimberly Bryant filed a federal lawsuit, 4:22-cv-04643, Bryant v. Hiles et al, on August 11, 2022, before she was removed as a director and dismissed as the CEO on August 12, 2022. The complaint alleges Sofia Mohammed and Heather Hiles, Stacy Brown-Philpot, and Sherman Whites, transferred the entire balance of the sole proprietorship business banking account, on or about February 5, 2022 while California Entity Number: 3453990, renamed BGC, INC., was suspended. 
    <br>
    <br>Suspension means the corporation loses its rights to its name. In California it's also a crime (a misdemeanor) for someone to transact, or try to transact, business through a suspended corporation.
    <br>
    <br>The allegation is that the Ficitious Business Name statement, filed on January 24, 2012, was used to open a bank account at Wells Fargo. An employee generated an employer identification number (EIN) for BLACK GIRLS CODE as a sole proprietorship, not one of the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporations. The EIN does not match the EIN used for annual filinigs submitted to the IRS, California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) and California Attorney General's Office Registry of Charitable Trusts.
    <br>
    <br>If true, this may render the two (2) service mark registrations as void if the wrong party was/is identified as the applicant/registrant.
